# ExternalHWID

## What is it?

ExternalHWID is a program with a GUI designed on giving the user their HWID and copying it to their clipboard.

## Why would I use it?

I would use it for something like a whitelist/blacklist, but it's up to you.

## Credits / Use

To be able to use my program, please leave credits to SyntheticJay/Jay#2823.

## Any problems?

## Any Libraries?

Yes, I am using the LoggerFramework I made, it's simple and quite easy to use, it provides not so much use for this, but it's something cool to have.
